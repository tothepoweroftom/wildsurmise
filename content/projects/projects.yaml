  desc: "Macalla delay is an experimental digital delay effect. With the glitch dial turned to 0 it operates as a standard digital delay. However the magic happens when you turn that glitch dial.
          Time is no longer linear, time itself oscillates and bends and distorts the delay line. The higher the value the more unpredictable the delay sound. <br/> <br/> 
          With Macalla delay create immersive textures from your live or recorded material. Shake up the predictable. Warp the fabric of spacetime. <br/><br/>"
